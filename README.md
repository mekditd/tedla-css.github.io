## CSS BootStrap HomeWork- Responsive Portfolio

### This Responsive Portfolio has taken place at UT-Austin Coding Bootcamp. --
It is designed to perform well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.--
### For this project Bootstrap is used to create:
* A navbar
* A responsive breakpoints layout for various screen sizes
* Responsive images
* Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns)
* Sticky footer
* Sub-rows
* sub-columns

Using these Bootstrap items minimizes the use of media queries.
